### Inventory Management System

This is a semester project developed in C++ for managing inventory in a cafe or any other business that requires 
inventory management. The system includes an admin account, a staff account, and a list of available stock. The 
program allows the user to add, update, and delete inventory items, as well as to place orders for more inventory.
It also stores employee data such as salary and bonus.

This is a terminal-based project and does not require any graphical libraries. The program is written to run on 
Windows 11 and can be compiled and executed using the Dev-C++ IDE.

The system includes the following functions:
- Add inventory
- Update inventory
- Delete inventory
- View inventory
- Place orders for more inventory
- View employee data

This project can be extended to include more features such as analytics, customer profiles, loyalty programs, 
and discounts.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
